A Dataverse for Teams environment is automatically created for the selected team when you create an app or bot in Microsoft Teams for the first time
or install a Power Apps app from the app catalog for the first time.

Tables that relate to one another have a relational connection.

1-N Relationship Example:
 - One Invoice with Many Line Item
 - One Classroom with Many Students

N-N
The many-to-many relationship (which is also called N:N) includes a special third table called a relationship table,
 sometimes called an intersect table, which maps how the many rows of one table can be related to the many rows of another table.
Books - Authors
  A book could have many authors
  A author could write many books

Choice Field - Display Values
ThisItem.Category

Multi Choice - Display Values
Concat(thisItem.'Preferred Delivery',Text(Value),", ")
The Property on the record is of type 'Table'

After you've created the column, you can't change the data type;
 therefore, before you create the column, consider how the apps and automation will be using the data.

 How to display filter options
Items formula will be:
 Filter(
  Accounts,
  Category = 'Category (Accounts)'.'Preferred Customer'
)

Table = Accounts
Category choice field within Accounts Table

Filter(
  Accounts, Category in ComboBoxCategory.SelectedItems
  || IsEmpty(ComboBoxCategory.SelectedItems)
)

When setting up a one-to-many relationship, you can also set up the relationship behaviors.
 Behaviors determine what should happen when the primary table row is deleted, assigned, shared, unshared, or reparented.

 Default behavior is REFERENCE - remove the link between parent / child

 - Choices fields are suitable for scenarios with rarely modified data,
