Client scripting runs on a model-driven form in response to form events.

Form Load or when is Saved
Data in column changed

Using the provided client scripting API,
  - you should implement your interaction with data,
  - form content changes,
  - or app behavior modifications.

  Another key high-level concept is the context objects that are available as event handler parameters or can be retrieved using special methods.
   - execution: Defines the event context in which your code executes
   - Form (This handler allows you to register OnLoad and OnSave event handlers.)
      - ui
      - data
   - Grid

   Upload Script
   The script must first be uploaded as a script web resource to use client scripting on a form.


(formContext) references the form or an item on the form
The data object (formContext.data) is intended to be used for any table and process data manipulation within the form.
formContext.data.entity.
formContext.data.process.
