FlowtriggeredbyaPowerapp.Run ( EmailAddress.Text, Response.Text );

Azure Service Bus

One integration must use an Azure Service Bus to send updates of the contact table to another system. You register a new service endpoint to a queue on the service bus. You add a step that triggers when a contact is updated.
When a service endpoint is registered, it will always post the complete plug-in execution context to the queue

The app must run specific code when a user selects a button on the ribbon.
Custom API


You need to use the client API to extend the behavior of the app.
OnSave
OnLoad


You are building a business process flow for a model-driven app. The business process flow is named BPFY and is created for a custom table named TableX.
Open a solution.
Create an instant flow.
Select the BPFY table.


You need to determine the form type when an event handler is called on a form.
formContext.ui.getFormType();

Which two type of events can you monitor? Each correct answer presents a complete solution.
You can monitor page navigation and network events in model-driven apps.

You need to add a button to the ribbon of the app.
The button must only display for users who have the Create privilege for the current table JavaScript function return true. Evaluation of the privilege condition should be done on the server.

a Display rule of type EntityPrivelegeRule to check the Create privilege on the PrimaryEntity
an Enable rule of type CustomRule to call the JavaScript function

You need to ensure that the data can be written from Microsoft Dataverse to the Oracle database.
Virtual tables

You need to ensure the business logic is performed as part of a Dataverse transaction.
Both Dataverse plug-ins and webhooks can be configured to run synchronously.

You need to send Microsoft Dataverse data to the functions.
Webhooks are used to publish Microsoft Dataverse data directly to an Azure function.

Tools for troubleshooting
Monitor, Fiddler AutoResponder, Browser developer tool


You need to ensure that when a button is selected, the action from the primary command is executed.
When the split button is selected, the action from the primary command is executed.



Dataverse
You need to show the revenue associated with the selected contact. To implement the requirement, you create a rollup column in the contact table.
Create a rollup column in the Insurance table to calculate the total revenue of the insurance.
 Create another column in the Insurance table and copy the result of the calculated column to it by using a business rule. The contact rollup column uses the copied column.



You need to prevent orphaned Employee records when deleting Department records.
Restrict


A tester reports that the new column is not searchable. 300 Dataset

The maximum of searchable columns indexed in the Microsoft Dataverse search is 1,000
The new column is not part of a quick find view.

You need to synchronize data from an external Microsoft Dataverse system. If a record already exists in Microsoft Dataverse, you must update the existing record. If a record does not exist in Microsoft Dataverse, you must create a new record.
Upsert updates the record if it exists or creates a new record if it does not exist, in one API call.

When the request gets an error, you want to inform the user about it in an error dialog.
 You need to show a message as well as the returned error message by using the Download Log File button.

Xrm.Navigation.openErrorDialog({ message: “There was an error during the request”, details: error.message });

You need to run queries against multiple Dataverse tables and return aggregated results.
FetchExpression

You need to ensure that when a user saves their changes, they are prevented from updating the record if another user has updated it.
Set ConcurrencyBehavior to IfRowVersionMatches.

You create a query to confirm that the data in Microsoft Dataverse is in sync with the data from external systems. The query must return the total number of changed rows with the data sorted in descending order.
The Web API header includes the $orderby query parameter.

You must create a custom data model to store company membership information of contacts. The membership must include a start and end date. Each contact can have memberships to different companies. Each company can have several members.
connection
custom relationship table

You need to store aggregated estimated revenue of each account’s open opportunities in a column in the accounts table.
A rollup column is correct because it is used to aggregate values from a related table that has a one-to-many relationship with the primary table.


You need to build business logic for the custom API and configure the custom API to run the business logic.
Write a plug-in for the custom API.
Update the custom API plug-in type in Power Apps.
Register the assembly using the Plug-in Registration tool (PRT).

You are migrating data into Dataverse tables using the Dataverse SDK for .NET. You use the methods in IOrganizationService.

Replace IOrganizationService with Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient.


Power Platform ALM
need to deploy changes to a managed solution
upgrade

The environment should not require available capacity and should not be automatically deleted.
Developer

The value of the environment variable is overwritten in the target environment whenever the solution is deployed.
The value is part of the solution.

You restructure your solutions and merge some of them together. When trying to uninstall one of the unnecessary solutions, you get a dependency error that is preventing the deletion.
Identify the topmost solution on the dependent component in the target organization.
Export the new version as managed and upgrade the solution in the target environment.
Prepare a new version of the solution in the organization environment where the solution either does not contain the dependency or has an updated version.







Power Automate
You need to configure the trigger so the flow only runs when a row is deactivated.
Row filter
Column filter

A user reports that the flow is not using the latest value of the environment variable.

Turn off the cloud flow and turn it on again.
Ensure that the correct value is configured as the environment’s local value.

With the filtering you need to apply, the result may contain more than 100,000 rows.

Add a new string variable to store the skip token.
Create a do-while loop for as long as the skip token variable is not empty. Add the list row to the loop and use the stored skip token.
Fetch the skip token from the List rows action and store it in another variable.

You need to ensure the flow runs and informs the admin when one row throws an error during the sync process.
Wrap all steps that could get errors into one scope.
Add a send email step as the catch step to inform an admin when something in the scope goes wrong.
